It is based on the foundation of modern medicine and spatial computing, decentralization, human-machine interface, and XR technology to reach patient hospitalization, robotic diagnosis, chronic disease awareness, and psychosomatic departments through privacy encryption, digital therapy presentation, and digital certified physician structure.",

Designed with a futuristic architectural appearance, there is a reception hall, a medical lecture hall, a medical history museum, consultation rooms, wards, ancillary treatment areas, and a psychological labyrinth, which allows users to visit HeLa Central Hospital and have experience and interaction at any time.The specialists in our hospital will accept appointments by patients on our website, according to which, they will enter the HeLa Central Hospital meta-universe to meet patients. At the moment, we have had a global telemedicine network and have recruited specialized physicians worldwide so that patients from any corner of the world can be seen by the physician, which could contribute to a significant reduction in off-site referrals, and routine checkups for chronic patients can also be finished at home.

For a long time, patients have often found it difficult to get good communication due to the large number of clients seen in medical institutions. However, communicating and comforting is an essential part of the medical process, so the corresponding information work includes the following two major directions: first, to make the communication channels more open with the help of existing information technology; second, to make the doctor-patient communication more visualized in the virtual space mode with the Metaverse concept and technology.",
